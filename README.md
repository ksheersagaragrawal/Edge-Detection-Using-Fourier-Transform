• Edge Detection In Images Using Fourier Transform [Aug’21-Nov’21]

    1. Researched about FFT,DFT and IDFT and implemented these functions to detect edges in images.
    2. Implemented the Discrete Fourier Transform and Fast Fourier Transform from scratch and implemented it on test
       images.
    3. Understood the math behind these functions and used Numpy and Mathplotlib libraries to show the Fourier transforms of
       the input images.
